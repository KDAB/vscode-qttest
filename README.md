# KDAB QtTest

This extension allows VSCode to know about Qt Tests. QtTestLib tests will appear in the side bar, under "Testing".<br>
The test slots are also exposed and runnable individually.

## Requirements

Only `CMake` based projects are supported at this time. The cmake extension (ms-vscode.cmake-tools) is used to determine
the build directory, and `ctest` is invoked to list the available tests, which were added with `add_test()`.

## Future plans

The bulk of this extension's code lives in a separate [nodejs module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@iamsergio/qttest-utils). That module is reusable, and exposes API ready to be used by other test extensions. We might integrate it with the `TestMate` extension, if its authors agree, or we might keep it separate, or both.


## Troubleshooting

In the output pane, chose `KDAB-QtTest` and see if there are any errors.
